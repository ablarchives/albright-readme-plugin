# ReadMe Plugin for OctoberCMS 2

## Usage
This plugin makes it easy to add an about and docs section to the settings area of an OctoberCMS application.

## Installation
Extract this into plugins/albrightlabs/readme. Create an "index.htm" file in plugins/albrightlabs/readme/config and add the HTML content to the file. This will need to be done before the plugin will work!
